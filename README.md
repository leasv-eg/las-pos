## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture

The system supports a hierarchical data structure:

```
Company (Tenant)
└── Store Concept (Brand/Format)
    └── Store (Physical Location)
        └── Device (Register/Tablet)
            └── User (Employee)
```

Each tenant's data is completely isolated at the database and API level.

## 🎯 User Stories (MVP)

### ✅ User Story 1: Login
**As a** Cashier  
**I want to** log in using my user number and password  
**So that** the system identifies me and tracks my sales  

### ✅ User Story 2: Basic Sale
**As a** Cashier  
**I want to** add products by entering their SKU  
**So that** I can build a customer's order  

### ✅ User Story 3: Finalize Sale
**As a** Cashier  
**I want to** complete the sale and register payment  
**So that** I can finish the transaction  

### ✅ User Story 4: Offline Transaction
**As a** Cashier  
**I want** the system to work offline and save transactions locally  
**So that** I can serve customers without interruption
