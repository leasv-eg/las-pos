# LAS POS Setup Guide

## Prerequisites Installation

Since Node.js is not currently installed on this system, you'll need to install it first.

### 1. Install Node.js

**Option A: Direct Download**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS version (recommended)
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
4. Restart your terminal/command prompt after installation

**Option B: Using Package Manager (Recommended)**
1. Install via Chocolatey (if you have it):
   ```powershell
   choco install nodejs
   ```

2. Or install via winget:
   ```powershell
   winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
   ```

### 2. Verify Installation

After installing Node.js, verify it works:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers for both commands.

## Project Setup

Once Node.js is installed:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required packages:
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- Styled Components
- Dexie (IndexedDB wrapper)
- PWA plugins and service workers

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on http://localhost:3000

### 3. Login to the Application

Use the demo credentials:
- **User Number**: `1`
- **Password**: `111`

   - Upload the `dist` folder
   - Configure the web server to serve `index.html` for all routes

3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.azurewebsites.net/api

## Next Steps

### Immediate Development
1. **Install Node.js** and run the application
2. **Test all features** using the demo data
3. **Customize branding** and colors
4. **Add more sample products** in `src/services/sampleData.ts`

### Production Roadmap
1. **API Development** - Build the backend REST API
2. **Hardware Integration** - Barcode scanners and receipt printers
3. **Payment Processing** - Integrate with payment terminals
4. **Advanced Features** - Inventory management, reporting, analytics

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that Node.js is properly installed
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
3. Verify the development server is running on port 3000
4. Check browser console for any error messages

The application is designed to work offline-first, so even without a backend API, you can test the complete POS workflow using the built-in sample data.
